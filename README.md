1. ` roll(<int number >)` recive a number and roll a dice for the number provided, returns an array of random numbers generated

2. ` containsDuplicates(<array of int>)` checks for the dupicates in array if

3.`calculateAverages(<array of int>) ` takes an array of integars and return the avarage of it

4. `calculateAveragesOfWeeklyLowestTemperature(<int[][] array>)` recives an array of integars and calculate the lowest avarage for the fo first diminsion of the array and returns its value


### Basics Libarary & linter Lab 03

**This Project include updates on the  java library adding more functionallity also it has  javascript linter for semicolons**
